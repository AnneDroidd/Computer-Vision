# Edge Detection

- AIM 1:
To study various edge detectors and see the effect of applying edge detectors on various images and comparing the results.

I have considered 5 images – 2 images of leaves and 3 images of text. Edge detection is performed using MATLAB as platform. I have compared Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt and Canny Edge Detectors. I have considered images of text, since the application of detecting texts is quite wide – Real time translation, converting images to text, etc.
